Service Based Systems (SBSs), like other software systems, evolve due to changes in both user requirements and execution contexts. Continuous evolution could easily deteriorate the design and reduce the Quality of Service (QoS) of SBSs and may result in poor design solutions, commonly known as SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) antipatterns. SOA antipatterns lead to a reduced maintainability and re-usability of SBSs. It is therefore critical to be able to detect and remove them to ensure the architectural quality of the software during its lifetime. In this paper, we present a novel approach named SOMAD-R (Service Oriented Mining for Antipattern Detection-Refactoring) which allows the refactoring of SOA antipatterns by building on a previously published tool named SOMAD (Service Oriented Mining for Antipattern Detection). SOMAD-R combines planning solving techniques and SOMAD detection algorithms to enable antipatterns driven refactoring of SBSs. As a first step towards refactoring antipatterns for SBSs, we successfully applied SOMAD-R to HomeAutomation, a SCA (Service Component Architecture) application and we removed three antipatterns (out of five) while improving application performance by 32%.
