During their evolution, Service Based Systems (SBSs) need to fit new user requirements and execution contexts. The resulting changes from the evolution of SBSs may degrade their design and Quality of Service (QoS), and thus may cause the appearance of common poor solutions, called Antipatterns. Like other complex systems, antipatterns in SBSs may hinder the future maintenance and evolution. Therefore, the automatic detection of such antipatterns is an important task for assessing the design and QoS of SBSs, to facilitate their maintenance and evolution. However, despite of their importance, no tool support exists for the detection of antipatterns in SBSs. In this paper, we introduce a prototype tool, called Soda, for detecting SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) antipatterns in SBSs.
