In recent years, mining bug report (BR) repositories has perhaps been one of the most active software engineering research fields. There exist many open source bug tracking and version control systems that developers and researchers can use to examine bug reports so as to reason about software quality. The issue is that these repositories use different interfaces and ways to access and represent data, which hinders productivity and reuse. To address this, we introduce BUMPER (BUg Metarepository for dEvelopers and Researchers), a common infrastructure for developers and researchers interested in mining data from many (heterogeneous) repositories. BUMPER is an open source web-based environment that extracts information from a variety of BR repositories and version control systems. It is equipped with a powerful search engine to help users rapidly query the repositories using a single point of access. To demonstrate the effectiveness of BUMPER, we use it to build a large dataset from a variety of repositories. The dataset contains more than one million bug reports and fixes. Both BUMPER and the dataset are publicly available at https://bumper-app.com.
